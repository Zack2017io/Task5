Wireshark Packet Capture Task

🛠️ What was done:
Installed and used Wireshark for network traffic analysis.

Captured packets by browsing a website and pinging a server.

Filtered packets to focus on specific protocols.

Identified at least three different protocols:

HTTP: Web browsing traffic.

TCP: Core transport protocol.

DNS: Resolves domain names.

Exported the capture as a .pcap file for documentation.

🔍 How packets were analyzed:
Reviewed individual packets in Wireshark by:

Checking packet number, source/destination IP, protocol, and length.

Inspecting headers and payload in the Packet Details pane.

Noting key fields like source/destination ports and flags.

📝 Findings:
Observed common protocols like HTTP, TCP, and DNS in web traffic.

Identified requests, responses, and connection setup packets (e.g., TCP SYN).

Noted source/destination IPs and packet content (e.g., DNS queries, HTTP GET requests).
